      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;"> Dear Human Adventurers,</p>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;"> Space travel places significant demands on the human body, and individuals who want to go into space must be in excellent physical condition. Astronaut candidates will undergo extensive medical evaluations and physical testing to ensure that they are healthy and fit to travel to space.
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;"> Additionally, astronaut candidates will receive extensive technical training on various aspects of spaceflight, including spacecraft systems, spacewalks, rendezvous and docking procedures, and emergency procedures. They will also undergo training on the use of various equipment, such as spacesuits, life support systems, and robotic arms.
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;"> In order to prepare for the physical and psychological demands of spaceflight, astronaut candidates will be put through simulations of spaceflight conditions, including microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and emergency scenarios. These simulations are conducted in specialized training facilities and can last for several weeks or months.
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;"> Finally, in case of an emergency landing or other unplanned events, astronauts will receive training on survival techniques and how to live off the land in remote and harsh environments.<br><br>

        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;">Our space agency would plan the launch window, taking into account various factors such as weather, orbital mechanics, and the readiness of the spacecraft and launch vehicle. The agency would also need to obtain all necessary permits and approvals from regulatory bodies. The launch vehicle, which is the rocket that carries the spacecraft into space, would need to undergo extensive testing and preparation. This would include fueling, integration of the spacecraft and other payloads, and final systems checks.Once the launch vehicle is ready, the spacecraft carrying the customers would be loaded onto the rocket, and the countdown sequence would begin. During the launch, the rocket would generate massive amounts of thrust, propelling the spacecraft and its passengers into space.
