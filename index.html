      <h1 style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><strong><u><center>Mission Planning (1-2 years):</center></strong></u>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>The mission planning phase involves defining the mission objectives, selecting the spacecraft design, developing<br>the mission timeline, and identifying the launch window. This process could take around 1-2 years to complete.</center>
      <h1 style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Pre-Launch Preparation (1 year):</strong></u></center>
      <h1 style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>Preparing for launch involves integrating the spacecraft with the launch vehicle, conducting system tests, and<br> finalizing mission procedures. This process could take around 1 year.</center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Launch and Travel Time (1-2 months):</strong></u></center> 
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>The travel time to the destination depends on the position of the planets in their orbits, the speed of the spacecraft, and <br> the mission objectives. Assuming a spacecraft traveling at a speed of 30,000,000 miles per hour, it would take around 1-2 <br> months to reach the gas giants, depending on the specific mission trajectory.</center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Mission Operations (1 week-1 year)</strong></u>:
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"> <center>Once the spacecraft arrives at the destination, the mission operations phase begins. This involves conducting scientific <br> investigations, analyzing data, and adjusting the mission plan as needed. This process could take around 1 week-1 year.</center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Return Journey (1-2 months):</strong></u></center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"> <center>After completing the mission objectives, the spacecraft would begin the return journey to Earth. Assuming a similar travel <br> time as the outbound journey, it would take around 1-2 months to return to Earth.</center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Post-Mission Analysis and Research (1-2 months):</u></strong></center>
      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>After the spacecraft returns to Earth, the mission data will be analyzed, and the results will be published in scientific journals.<br>This process could take around 1-2 months.<br><br><br><br><center>

      <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;">In addition to this thought out schedule, Astro Adventurers Inc. takes safety into consideration. We make sure that our customers can feel at ease when traveling and enjoying their stay in space. Here are the following safety measures Astro Adveturers Inc. will take to ensure maximum safety for our customers:<br>
      </br>
        <h1 style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Pre-Flight Medical Screening:</u></strong></center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>Our agency will conduct a thorough medical screening of our customers before the trip to ensure that they are healthy and fit to travel to<br> space. This would involve a comprehensive physical examination, as well as assessments of our customers' medical history, medications, and allergies.</center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Training and Preparation:</u></strong></center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>Our customers need to undergo rigorous training and preparation before the space trip. This would include simulations of spaceflight conditions, <br> emergency procedures, and use of equipment such as space suits and life support systems.</center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Spacecraft Safety Systems:</u></strong></center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>The spacecraft would be equipped with state-of-the-art safety systems, such as radiation shielding, emergency oxygen supply, and fire suppression <br> systems. The spacecraft would also have redundant systems to ensure continued operation in case of a malfunction.</center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Launch Vehicle Safety:</u></strong></center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>The launch vehicle, which is the rocket that carries the spacecraft into space, would be designed with strict safety standards, including thorough <br> testing and quality control checks. The launch vehicle would also have an abort system to ensure that the customers can be safely returned <br>to Earth in case of a malfunction. </center> 
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Crew Training:</u></strong></center>   
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>The crew members who are responsible for operating the spacecraft and managing the mission would be highly trained and experienced in spaceflight <br> operations and emergency procedures.</center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u>Medical Support:</u></strong></center>    
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>Our space agency will have medical personnel on board the spacecraft to provide immediate medical support in case of an emergency. Our agency <br> would also have arrangements with medical facilities on Earth to provide remote medical support and treatment.</center> 
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center><strong><u> Emergency Procedures:</u></strong></center>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"><center>Our space agency would have well-defined emergency procedures in place for various contingencies, such as loss of communication with the spacecraft, <br> spacecraft malfunction, or medical emergencies.</center><br><br><br>
        </h1></br>
        <p style = "color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: xx-large;">Once the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere, it will need to land safely. The agency would need to choose a landing site that is suitable and has been cleared of any potential hazards. The spacecraft's landing systems, including parachutes or rocket thrusters, would be used to slow down and land the spacecraft safely. Once the spacecraft has landed, the agency would need to retrieve the customers safely. Our agency will ensure that the customers are in good health and provide any necessary medical attention or support. After the recovery, the agency would provide debriefing sessions to the customers to gather feedback and assess their overall experience. The agency would also need to provide any necessary post-mission support, including medical, psychological, or emotional support, if needed.
